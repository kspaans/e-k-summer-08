Style Guide:
- Use kernel style
- if understand(kernel_style) ? use_kernel_style(you) : use_local() || use_K&R
- Always indent with tabs
- Comment blocks of code/functions
- 80 characters per line max

Design Guide:
- Write up APIs/headers first (For clarity of functionality and intended
  purpose)
- Write tests for expected functionality
- Write code to complete tests
- See code for examples of test suites
