===========T3H Hex Editor===========
- What does a hex editor do?
	- It lets us modify binary files.
- How does it do it?
	- I'm thinking that it'll be too complex for now to write piddley
	  interactive stuff. I prefer to think of something along the lines
	  of xxd/hexdump output to a file, but then you can edit that file
	  with $EDITOR, and have the hexeditor write it back as a binary
	  file. So the initial output will look a lot like output from xxd
	  (perhaps with similar options), but the trick is we'll support
	  things like comments in the input file, and allow the input file
	  to be read and translated back from hexadecimal to a raw binary
	  file.
